# AutoEstimator--Predict_Your_Car-s_Worth
This project is a machine learning-based web app that predicts the sale value of used cars. It uses a deep learning model (MLP) built with TensorFlow and a dataset of used car prices. The app, developed with Streamlit, allows users to input car details and receive an estimated price.
